This project explores a new design for bagless vacuum cleaners. Most vacuum cleaners use a cyclonic filter which is widely patented by Dyson. The design here is based on a laminar flow which could at least consume less power due to less pressure drop.

For now, the concept only explores the filtering part of the vacuum cleaner, the design is not ready to use.

Any contribution is welcome, the goal being to have a 3D printable design in order to enable end users to produce their own.
